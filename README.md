# Bootstrap_Practice
I create a Tech Conference user interface registration system.
To create this user interface for tech conference i used HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP and some javascript.
I implement conference table, registration form, header and footer section with proper details as per the project requirements.
i also implement session link to click to display about conference and about the conference speaker details.
i add hover system in table, button and social media icons. this interface is responsive for all display size.
